In this project, I leveraged SQL queries and Tableau to provide in-depth insights into customer behavior and sales performance, aiming to support business decision-making. The dashboard has been designed to be more interactive, user-friendly, and aligned with company branding while offering new analytical perspectives and KPIs.

Key Features and Improvements:
Revised Customer Data Overview:

Enhanced the original dashboard by providing a comprehensive view of customer identity, contact, and location data.
Introduced a custom addressing title for customers, and incorporated the latest available address by selecting the maximum AddressId to avoid duplicate data.
Focused on key sales metrics: number of orders, total sales (with tax), and the date of the last order, ordered by total amount.
New Insight: Introduced average profit per customer as a new metric, which provides additional depth to customer segmentation and business decision-making.
Active vs Inactive Customer Segmentation:

Segment customers into active and inactive based on their ordering history, marking those who haven’t ordered in the past 365 days.
Added a dynamic parameter for users to easily toggle between active and inactive customer segments on the dashboard.
New Insight: Introduced a Year-Over-Year Growth Percentage for active customers, which helps in tracking customer engagement over time.
North American Customer Insights:

Focused on North American customers who have either ordered over 2500 in total or placed 5+ orders.
Address line was split into two distinct columns, improving readability and analysis.
New Insight: Analyzed customer lifetime value based on total spending, offering a deeper understanding of customer profitability and loyalty.
Sales Reporting and Tax Analysis:

Generated detailed monthly sales reports by country and region, including metrics like the number of orders, customers, and salespeople.

Additional KPIs like average order size and salesperson performance have been incorporated, offering deeper insights into operational efficiency.
Data Sources and Documentation:

Integrated new data from Google Sheets, ensuring a more comprehensive data source by adding additional CSV files.
Provided detailed documentation for all SQL queries used, which are available in a separate Google Sheet, ensuring transparency and traceability of data extraction logic.
